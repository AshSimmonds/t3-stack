# T3 stack resources  
  
Personal repo for documenting stuff as I go about learning and devving in NextJS, Typescript, tRPC, Tailwind, Postgres, Railway, Vercel, etc.  
  
## Quick start  
  
Initially a compression of a [proposed tutorial](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app/issues/166#create-t3-app) with more details for a newcomer, still evolving as of 2022-07-24 on [t3-oss/create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app). The following is more a quick refresher of just the hit points when you don't need explanations but just to follow the bouncing ball.
